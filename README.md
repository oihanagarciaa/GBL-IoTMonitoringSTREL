## RUNTIME VERIFICATION FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL PROPERTIES OVER IOT NETWORKS [![Technical Debt](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=oihanagarciaa_GBL-IoTMonitoringSTREL&metric=sqale_index)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=oihanagarciaa_GBL-IoTMonitoringSTREL)

### Middleware

<p>The Middleware connects different components or applications with each other.
This project uses SOA architecture.</p>
<img src="https://github.com/oihanagarciaa/GBL-IoTMonitoringSTREL/blob/main/Documents/Images/Middleware-Middleware%20diagram.drawio%20(2).png"/>
<p>These are the services you can find in this project: <br>
<strong><em>Runner service</em></strong><br>
The runner service receives the commands to <strong>set up the other services
</strong>. When the project is initialized, the runner subscribes to a broker
to listen to the clientâ€™s orders. The client can start the other services with
customized features and also stop them.
<br><strong><em>Moonlight service</em></strong><br>
This service <strong>stores</strong> the messages, is in charge of the <strong>
processing</strong> for Moonlight to be able to monitor and finally Moonlight
gives a <strong>feedback</strong>.
<br><strong><em>Sensor service</em></strong><br>
This service manages the <strong>data gathering</strong>. It gets the sensor's messages.
<br><strong><em>Thingsboard service</em></strong><br>
Sends the results and the sensors values to Thingsboard to <strong>present them
to the human operator</strong>

The services communicate using a unique Data Bus, a singleton class.
</p>

### Client
<p>The client sends a JSON to the Runner with the list of services and their 
properties. Here is an example:</p>

```json

	"services": [
		{
			"serviceId": "sensorService",
			"command": "start",

		},
		{

			            val f1 = temp and (eventually(humidity) within interval(0, 1)) 
			            or somewhere(humidity) 

			            Specification.formula = f1"
		},
		{

	        }
        ]
}
```
